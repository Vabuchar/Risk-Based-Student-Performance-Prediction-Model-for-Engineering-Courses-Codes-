# Risk-Based-Student-Performance-Prediction-Model-for-Engineering-Courses-Codes-Implementation
This repository provides the code and example files for estimating fragility curves for assessing student performance in engineering courses. The repository includes three main files:

1. CaseStudy.py: Primary code that calls the main function to generate fragility curves, example database, and performs the analysis and visualization of interest.
2. fragility_function_CG.py: Code responsible for generating fragility curves.
3. InputData.xlsx: Example file used in the study outlined in the paper "Risk-Based Student Performance Prediction Model for Engineering Courses," which presents this methodology in the educational context. The two main columns of interest are "GPA" (Cumulative Grade Point Average) and "CG" (Course Grade
